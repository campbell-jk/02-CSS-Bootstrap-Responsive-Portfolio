# Welcome to my portfolio project!

This project was definitely a challenge, but in the most enjoying kind of way!

It seemed like every step that I took to getting the website to look like the model, I ended up breaking something else. Each time I broke something, I had to stop, use DevTools and then use my google fu to figure out what I had stopped.

I discovered a lot of neat tricks and feel as though now I have a much stronger grasp on CSS as a language.

I hope you enjoy! Your feedback is much appreciated.

# The Process

I ended up restarting the code fresh about 4 hours into coding. My partner, Rob (he's in the About Me ^-^) is a software engineer so he was looking at the issues I was running into and gave me some great suggestions as far as organizing my CSS sheets and what to look for when things aren't going as intended.

I learned a lot about adding classes and ids, how to apply them and the beauty of using !important in CSS.

My favorite learning bit was using @media {} in CSS to stack the screen sizes, setting some "rules" to make the style change when the screen size did.

I'm really proud of the result, and I am excited to build a version of this that is personalized and not modeled after the demonstration.
